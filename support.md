## Getting Help

The easiest way to get help with general Steamworks features ingeneral is by posting on the [Steamworks discussion board](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/discussions). If your question is more Steamworks.NET oriented you can find the official Steamworks discussion thread over [here](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/discussions/0/666827974770212954/).

If you have run into an issue that you suspect is specific to Steamworks.NET feel free to report it either directly via [Email](mailto:support@rileylabrecque.com) or through the [Github issues](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/issues) page.

1-on-1 support through Skype, Steam or Email is available by donating $40 USD or greater. I can only help with Steamworks.NET specific issues such as initial setup or GameObject troubles, general API questions should be asked on the Steamworks discussion board.
